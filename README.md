# tmux-launcher
Launches tmux in a 4-quadrant split or a slightly-less-than 1/3:2/3 vertical split configuration.

I wrote this specifically to configure tmux in ways that I use it regularly, but it can also make you look like a badass
terminal hacker.

Don't forget! Hood up. Raybans on. Configure it any way you like, change it any way you like. It's just an example of how
one can automatically configure tmux sessions.
